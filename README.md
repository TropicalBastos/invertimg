# invertimg

Invert jpg and png files on the fly with the command line, no need for crazy heavy image manipulation GUI's!
To install from source simple clone the repository and:

`./configure.sh`

Make sure you have given the file execute permissions

##Usage:

The program takes only two arguments: the input file and where the file should be outputted

`invertimg [fileInput] [fileOutput]`

For example:
`sudo invertimg plane.jpg invertedplane.jpg`


Feel free to contribute to add anymore features to this otherwise one-dimensional program!
